Portfolio-Scoped version of https://github.com/its-bzak/jobtracker

This repository is intended to showcase my experience and understanding of core full-stack development concepts through a deliberately scoped, single-developer project.

- JWT based authentication and role-based authentication
- CRUD operations across relational data models
- RESTful API design and handling of requests
- Server-side validation and error handling
- Communication between client and server using HTTP
- Conditional rendering for frontend
- Filtering and querying data
- Version control and iterative development using Git
