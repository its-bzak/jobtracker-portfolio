# Job Tracker Application

***What?*** - This application is an all-in-one job search tool and application handler. Companies and Employers will have the ability to 
post job listings, where candidates will then be able to apply on that very same application. Applications submitted by candidates will be sent
to the company, where they will be subject to review before being sent back to the candidate with a status update reflecting the decision of the employer.

***Why?*** - As a current college student, the process of applying for various internships and jobs has really highlighted to me how much the current process
could be improved upon. For example, the current application process involves creating a new login for each of the companies you apply to, keeping track of a
plethora of emails, etc. The goal of my application is to create a simpler, more streamlined process for both the job candidate, as well as the company.


***How?*** - 
The tech stack for this project is as follows:

|  Area  |Tech Used|
|--------|---------|
|Frontend|React + Vite|
|Backend |Django REST Framework|
| Auth.  | JWT |
|Deployment| TBD |

The Django REST Framework will allow me to create various API endpoints that will allow applications to be created, read, updated and deleted. Additionally,
leveraging relationships such as one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many will allow me to create a smooth, effective application to be used by the
public.
