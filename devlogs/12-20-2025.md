# *Developer Log #2*
As the holiday season comes closer, I'd had less time at my laptop, but this does not mean that I have not been working on this project.
While I may not have had the opportunity to sit down and write code in the past few days, this does not mean that I haven't been planning 
and coming up with ideas as to what I want to accomplish next. 

The plan for today's coding session is as follows:

- Create a 'promote to interview' endpoint. This will be how employers will grant interviews to applicants without the use of the /admin site. (completed)
- Add resume / cover letter attributes to Application models.
- Create JobAppQuestion and JobAppAnswers models so employers can add their own custom questions for applicants in the application process.
- Configure api/job-postings/id/apply endpoint to allow applicants to apply to a specific posting, creating an application object.
this object should be saved in case the user exits out of the application/draft prior to submission.

Best,  
Ryan
